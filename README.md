# Unsupervised Learning for Social Media Engagement: A Facebook Analysis for Thailand Sellers

This project focuses on analyzing social media engagement patterns, specifically the impact of photo content, for Facebook Live sellers in Thailand. As part of a marketing consulting firm, the analysis aims to challenge or validate the assumption that photo posts are the most engaging form of content. By analyzing various types of content and their engagement metrics, this project provides insights into the role of photos in driving user reactions, such as likes and loves.

Key Objectives:
Content Performance Analysis: A detailed comparison of how photos perform relative to other content types in terms of overall engagement and specific reactions.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): A dimensionality reduction technique to identify the core factors influencing social media engagement, based on the available dataset metrics.
K-means Clustering: Segmenting Facebook posts into clusters based on their engagement patterns and other relevant features, providing actionable insights for content strategy.
Logistic Regression Models: Developing and comparing logistic regression models to predict whether a post is a photo based on original features, PCA results, and cluster groupings.
This project applies unsupervised learning techniques and regression modeling to derive meaningful insights for improving social media engagement strategies. From understanding principal components to cluster analysis and logistic regression, the analysis offers both theoretical exploration and practical recommendations for enhancing the effectiveness of photo content on Facebook.
